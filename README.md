This repository is used to manage our final project in the Project Repository (TI3501) module. We'll change features of the project that manages legal absences of employees according to what our client wants.


ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS:

Question 1:

Those new requests are composed of interesting elements but the 4 first ones are already in our backlog. Therefore, we can only add the last two in our backlog.
Add a new page called "bye.html" that simply shows the text "Ciao ! We hope to see you again soon."
On the first (login) page, add a button to the right of the "Login" button. The label should be "I changed my mind" and when the user clicks on it the "bye.html" page is opened.
However, these changes are only about aesthetics and don’t do much for the overall functionality of the project. As such we don’t really need to implement them and they don’t need to appear in the backlog. The 4 others are important and as such, we already thought about them and appear in the backlog.

Question 2:

 There are 5 steps in ALM (Application Lifecycle Management): Plan/analyse ; Build ; Test ; Deploy ; Maintenance. When we use Github, we are creating the code. As such when we are working on Github, we are in the Build step. However, since we are making updates and adding new features, we are also in the step Maintenance.

Question 3:

The C-cycle methodology is based as Verification and Validation model and forms a V-shape. If we had to work on the V-cycle methodology, the tasks would be done in a very specific order. First, we should do the analysis of what is required for the client. Next, the design and the architecture should be represented, which is very different from our methodology. The design is much more important than the coding. However, our team works first on the requirement for the client and after the coding and after the testing phase. 
Finally, if the V-cycle methodology would be applied, we should give more importance to the design phase.
